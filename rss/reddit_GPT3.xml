                <title>Video-ChatGPT: Redefining Interactions with Visual Data</title>

                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished reading a fascinating machine learning research paper lets jump in.</p> <p>If you want the latest AI news as it drops, <a href="https://www.theedge.so/subscribe">look here first</a>. But all of the information is here for your convenience.</p> <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p> <p><strong>Advancements in multimodal learning, New dataset and evaluation framework, it is an Open-source release.</strong></p> <p>This innovative model merges video and language in a way that allows for meaningful, detailed conversations about videos.<br /> This approach draws inspiration from vision-language (VL) models, typically used for video domain tasks. However, given the scarcity of video-caption pairs and the hefty resources required to train on such data, VL models usually rely on pre-trained image-based models for video tasks. Video-ChatGPT builds upon the Language-aligned Large Vision Assistant (LLaVA), which marries the visual encoder of CLIP with the Vicuna language decoder.<br /> LLaVA has been fine-tuned end-to-end on generated instructional vision-language data. With Video-ChatGPT, we take this one step further and fine-tune this model using video-instruction data, priming it for video conversation tasks.<br /> A question-answer pair makes up the video-instruction data. By training Video-ChatGPT with this setup, the model gains a comprehensive understanding of videos, cultivates attention to temporal relationships, and develops conversation capabilities.</p> <p><strong>But what sets Video-ChatGPT apart?</strong> For the first time, we've got a quantitative video conversation evaluation framework at our disposal. This novel framework permits accurate evaluation of video conversation models, based on aspects like correctness of information, detail orientation, contextual understanding, temporal understanding, and consistency.</p> <p>The training dataset for Video-ChatGPT is a collection of 100,000 video-instruction pairs, pulled from various video-sharing platforms and manually reviewed for relevance and accuracy. This dataset is another exciting contribution of Video-ChatGPT and is set to be an excellent resource for future research in video conversation models.<br /> <strong>But how does this affect you?</strong> Think of its applications in education, entertainment, and surveillance. Teachers can give tailored feedback based on student video submissions; content creators can craft interactive, engaging video content; and surveillance systems can generate real-time insights from video footage.</p> <p>It's not just a tool, but an open platform that invites collaboration, exploration, and a plethora of new applications. From augmenting educational tools, enhancing entertainment experiences, to boosting surveillance effectiveness, Video-ChatGPT's potentials are endless.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of this below.</p> <p>Link to <a href="https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-ChatGPT">Github</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Evening_Temporary36"> /u/Evening_Temporary36 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/147552c/videochatgpt_redefining_interactions_with_visual/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/147552c/videochatgpt_redefining_interactions_with_visual/">[comments]</a></span></description>

                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In a German town, ChatGPT conducted a Lutheran church service, attracting over 300 attendees. The chatbot preached, led prayers, and generated music for the service.</p> <p><strong>Event Background:</strong> The AI-led church service was part of a larger convention of Protestants, held every two years in different locations across Germany.</p> <ul> <li>The convention, attracting tens of thousands of believers, is a platform for prayer, song, discussion, and exploration of current global issues.</li> <li>This year's issues included global warming, the war in Ukraine, and artificial intelligence.</li> </ul> <p><strong>AI Role in the Service:</strong> ChatGPT, with inputs from Jonas Simmerlein, a theologian from the University of Vienna, generated the church service.</p> <ul> <li>Simmerlein provided ChatGPT with cues, asking it to develop the sermon based on the convention's motto &quot;Now is the time&quot;.</li> <li>The chatbot was also instructed to include psalms, prayers, and a closing blessing. Four avatars represented the AI throughout the service.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Audience Reactions:</strong> The attendees' responses varied. Some were engaged, videotaping the event on their phones, while others were more critical and reserved. Some found the AI's delivery monotonous and lacking in emotional resonance, which hampered their ability to focus.</p> <p><strong>Expert Opinions:</strong> While some experts recognized the potential of AI in enhancing accessibility and inclusivity in religious services, concerns were raised about AI's human-like characteristics possibly deceiving believers.</p> <ul> <li>The AI's potential to represent a singular viewpoint, instead of reflecting the diversity within Christianity, was also highlighted as a potential risk.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Future of AI in Religion:</strong> Simmerlein clarified that the purpose of using AI is not to replace religious leaders but to aid them in their work.</p> <ul> <li>The AI could assist with sermon preparation, freeing up time for leaders to focus on individual spiritual guidance.</li> <li>However, the experiment highlighted limitations, such as the AI's inability to interact with or respond to the congregation like a human pastor.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-church-protestants-chatgpt-ai-sermon-651f21c24cfb47e3122e987a7263d348">Source (APnews)</a></p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> I run a <a href="https://dupple.com/techpresso">ML-powered news aggregator</a> that summarizes with an <strong>AI</strong> the best tech news from <strong>40+ media</strong> (TheVerge, TechCrunch…).

                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently expressed his concerns over the release of ChatGPT at a conference in India.</p> <p>This is however, not a first. Sam Altman has repeatedly voiced his concerns regarding ChatGPT and AI in general, even going so far as to asking for regulation himself in front of US Congress.</p> <p>In a conversation during a recent trip to India, Altman said he was worried that he did &quot;something really bad&quot; by creating ChatGPT, which was released in November and sparked a surge of interest in artificial intelligence.</p> <p>&quot;What I lose the most sleep over is the hypothetical idea that we already have done something really bad by launching ChatGPT,&quot; Altman told Satyan Gajwani, the vice chairman of Times Internet, at an event on Wednesday organized by the Economic Times. (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-he-is-losing-sleep-over-chatgpt-2023-6">link</a>)</p> <p>After the ultra-rapid pace of development in AI this year, specifically after the launch of ChatGPT, a lot of voice has been raised related to regulating and monitoring AI. There are two broad camps that have emerged in light of this:</p> <ol> <li>One camp aims to halt and slow down the pace of AI development. Just recently only, a big group of tech leaders called for a moratorium on AI progress which included big names like Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak.</li> <li>The other camp acknowledges the fears and dangers surrounding AI, and instead of curbing the progress altogether, has called for government intervention to create policies surrounding the regulation of AI.</li> </ol> <p>Sam Altman has been a verbose proponent of the second camp.

                <title>Lawyers blame ChatGPT for tricking them into citing bogus case law</title>
                <link>https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/145t3ta/lawyers_blame_chatgpt_for_tricking_them_into/</link>
                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Two lawyers</strong> in New York might face sanctions for submitting fictitious legal research in a court filing, which they claim was provided by the AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT. The lawyers had used the AI tool to search for legal precedents for a case they were handling, but ended up referencing non-existent court cases suggested by the AI.</p> <p><strong>Here's a recap:</strong></p> <p><strong>Involvement of ChatGPT in Legal Proceedings:</strong> The lawyers, Steven Schwartz and Peter LoDuca, employed ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, to find legal precedents for a case against Avianca, a Colombian airline. The chatbot, known for generating essay-like answers, suggested several aviation-related court cases, which the lawyers included in their lawsuit filing. They later found out that many of these cases were non-existent or involved non-existent airlines.</p> <ul> <li>The lawyers trusted the AI bot's suggestions without verifying them, leading to the inclusion of these fictitious cases in their court filing.</li> <li>Schwartz confessed to the judge that he was under the misconception that ChatGPT was pulling information from sources inaccessible to him.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Impact and Consequences:</strong> The use of non-existent cases led to a significant issue in the lawsuit, with the judge expressing disappointment and concern over the lawyers' failure to validate the cases. Avianca's lawyers and the court initially identified the fictitious case references, but Schwartz and LoDuca did not act promptly to correct them.</p> <ul> <li>The judge, P. Kevin Castel, confronted the lawyers about the bogus legal references, leading to apologies from both lawyers.</li> <li>Schwartz shared his embarrassment and remorse over the situation, assuring that safeguards had been put in place to prevent a recurrence.</li> <li>LoDuca admitted his lack of adequate review of the material compiled by Schwartz.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Larger Conversation around AI:</strong> The incident triggered broader discussions on AI use and the need for understanding and regulation. The case illustrated the potential risks of using AI technologies without fully understanding their operation.</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, and the AI's potential to revolutionize work and learning has sparked both excitement and concern.</li> <li>An adjunct professor at the Center for Legal and Court Technology highlighted the dangers of using AI technologies without knowing the associated risks.</li> <li>Many industry leaders have voiced concerns over potential threats from AI, arguing for their mitigation to be a global priority.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Legal Repercussions:</strong> The lawyers are now facing possible punishment over their reliance on AI-generated, non-existent legal precedents. However, their law firm argues that this was due to carelessness and not bad faith, urging the judge to avoid sanctions.</p> <ul> <li>Their attorney argued that the lawyers, particularly Schwartz, had a hard time with new technology and made an error in using the AI without fully understanding it.</li> <li>The judge has not yet ruled on the potential sanctions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Implications for the Legal Profession and AI:</strong> This case has sparked discussions in legal and technology circles, underscoring the importance of understanding AI technologies before using them in professional settings. It also highlights the potential risks and consequences of misuse.</p> <ul> <li>This case was presented at a conference attended by legal professionals, and it generated shock and confusion.</li> <li>The incident marks the first documented potential professional misconduct involving generative AI in the legal field.</li> <li>Experts have stressed on the importance of understanding the AI technologies, citing their potential to &quot;hallucinate,&quot; i.e., generate fictitious but seemingly realistic information.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b">Source (APnews)</a></p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> I run a <a href="https://dupple.com/techpresso">ML-powered news aggregator</a> that summarizes with <strong>GPT-4</strong> the best tech news from <strong>40+ media</strong> (TheVerge, TechCrunch…).

                <description><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks,</p> <p>We just built a v1 of <a href="http://langfuse.com/">langfuse.com</a>, an open-source experimentation platform for LLM-based applications. We help devs iterate and debug prompts while also collecting valuable user feedback on completions. It’s all based on capturing LLM I/O, additional metadata, and enriching it with user feedback from the front end.</p> <p>Background: over the last 2 months, we have built multiple products with LLMs and continuously had the problem of segmenting use cases in production and making implicit/explicit user feedback actionable. That’s what we solve with langfuse.</p> <p>We’re open source and any candid feedback is appreciated if you are building with LLMs. Feel free to just msg. me here or email us at [<a href="mailto:team@langfuse.com">team@langfuse.com</a>](mailto:<a href="mailto:team@langfuse.com">team@langfuse.com</a>)</p> <p>Happy to include Reddit-builders in our small group of users that we help in (mostly) any capacity we can.</p> <p>Thanks, Max</p> <p>P.S.: If you like what you see, feel free to drop us a star on GitHub ⭐ and show some love to open source 😊 —&gt; <a href="https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/">https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Deichlord"> /u/Deichlord </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/1456xro/launching_opensource_experimentation_platform_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/1456xro/launching_opensource_experimentation_platform_for/">[comments]</a></span></description>

This case, the first of its kind in AI, could establish a precedent for accountability regarding AI-generated content. </p> <p><strong>Background of the Lawsuit</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Mark Walters, host of Armed America Radio, filed a defamation lawsuit against OpenAI.</li> <li>This comes after an incident where the AI chatbot, ChatGPT, provided misleading information about Walters.</li> <li>According to the lawsuit, Fred Riehl, editor-in-chief of AmmoLand, asked ChatGPT for a summary of the court case &quot;Second Amendment Foundation v. Ferguson.&quot;</li> </ul> <p><strong>ChatGPT's Misinformation</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>ChatGPT incorrectly claimed that Walters, supposedly the treasurer and chief financial officer of the Second Amendment Foundation, had been embezzling and defrauding funds from the organization.</li> <li>Furthermore, the AI bot alleged Walters had manipulated financial records, failed to provide accurate financial reports, and concealed his activities.</li> <li>These allegations were baseless as Walters neither works for the Second Amendment Foundation nor has ever been involved in financial fraud with the organization.</li> <li>In reality, the actual court case &quot;Second Amendment Foundation v. Ferguson&quot; pertains to gun laws and does not mention Walters at all.</li> </ul> <p><strong>ChatGPT's Insistence on False Information</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>When Riehl sought confirmation from ChatGPT about the provided details, the AI chatbot reiterated the false information.</li> <li>The AI chatbot even quoted a nonexistent paragraph purportedly from the court case, and cited an incorrect case number.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Outcome and Future Implications</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Riehl refrained from publishing an article based on ChatGPT's false information, but Walters proceeded to sue OpenAI, seeking punitive damages.</li> <li>This lawsuit is the first instance of &quot;AI hallucinations&quot; being brought to court and might lead to more such cases in the future, as AI systems continue to generate false information.<br /></li> </ul> <p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/openai-chatgpt-defamation-lawsuit-details">Source (Mashable)</a> </p> <p><strong>PS:</strong> I run a <a href="https://dupple.com/techpresso">ML-powered news aggregator</a> that summarizes with <strong>GPT-4</strong> the best tech news from <strong>40+ media</strong> (TheVerge, TechCrunch…).

Kevin Castel 就虚假的法律参考资料与律师对质，导致两位律师道歉。</li> <li>Schwartz 分享了他对这种情况的尴尬和悔恨，并保证已采取保护措施以防止再次发生。</li> <li>LoDuca 承认他缺乏对 Schwartz 编写的材料进行了充分审查。</li> </ul> <p><strong>围绕 AI 的更广泛对话</strong>：该事件引发了关于 AI 使用以及理解和监管需求的更广泛讨论。该案例说明了在不完全了解人工智能技术运作的情况下使用人工智能技术的潜在风险。</p> <ul> <li>微软投资了 ChatGPT 的创建者 OpenAI，而人工智能革新工作和学习的潜力引发了双方的兴奋</li> <li>法律和法院技术中心的一位兼职教授强调了在不知道相关风险的情况下使用人工智能技术的危险。</li> <li>许多行业领导者对潜在威胁表示担忧</li> </ul> <p><strong>法律影响</strong>：这些律师现在可能因依赖 AI 生成的、非-现有的法律先例。然而，他们的律师事务所辩称，这是由于粗心而不是恶意，敦促法官避免制裁。</p> <ul> <li>他们的律师辩称，律师，尤其是 Schwartz，很难与新的技术，并在没有完全理解它的情况下使用 AI 时犯了错误。</li> <li>法官尚未裁定可能的制裁。</li> </ul> <p><strong>对法律的影响职业与 AI：</strong>此案引发了法律和技术界的讨论，强调了在专业环境中使用 AI 技术之前了解它们的重要性。它还强调了滥用的潜在风险和后果。</p> <ul> <li>这个案例是在一个有法律专业人士参加的会议上提出的，它引起了震惊和混乱。</li> <li>事件标志着这是法律领域首次记录到涉及生成式 AI 的潜在专业不当行为。</li> <li>专家们强调了理解 AI 技术的重要性，并指出它们有可能“产生幻觉”、即生成虚构但看似真实的信息。</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b">来源 (APnews) </a></p> <p><strong>PS：</strong>我运行了一个<a href="https://dupple.com/techpresso">机器学习驱动的新闻聚合器</a>，总结了<strong>GPT-4</strong> 来自 <strong>40 多家媒体</strong>（TheVerge、TechCrunch 等）的最佳科技新闻。如果您喜欢这个分析，您会喜欢从这个工具中收到的内容！</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;由&#32;提交<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Super-Waltz-5676"> /u/Super-Waltz-5676 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https: //www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/145t3ta/lawyers_blame_chatgpt_for_tricking_them_into/">[链接]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/145t3ta/lawyers_blame_chatgpt_for_tricking_them_into/">[评论]</a></span></description>
